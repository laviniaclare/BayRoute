BayRoute is an interactive map that allows users to select and view routes from various transit systems in the Bay Area.  When a transit line is selected, the entire route is displayed on the map, helping users visualize what destinations are accessible to them via public transportation.  Includes route data for all buses, shuttles, ferries and commuter trains in the 511.org data base.  Growing up in the Bay Area I was frequently frustrated with the lack of a unified transit map.  This project was my solution to that frustration. Technologies used: Mapbox API, Postgresql, 511.org database, Python, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, Flask, Jinja, SQLAlchemy, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
